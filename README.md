0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration.

Each task is linked and will help you to:

put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file

create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
s a command interpreter?

Do you remember the Shell? s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:
Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
Retrieve an object from a file, a database Do operations on objects (count, compute stats)
Update attributes of an object
Destroy an object

0. README, AUTHORS
Write a README.md
You should have an AUTHORS file at the root of your repository, listing all individuals having contributed content to the repository. For format, reference s AUTHORS page

1. Be pycodestyle compliant!
Write beautiful code that passes the pycodestyle checks.

2. Unittests
All your files, classes, functions must be tested with unit tests

3. BaseModel
Write a class BaseModel that defines all common attributes/methods for other classes

4. Create BaseModel from dictionary
Previously we created a method to generate a dictionary representation of an instance (method to_dict()).

Now s time to re-create an instance with this dictionary representation.

5. Store first object
Now we can recreate a BaseModel from another one by using a dictionary representation

6. Console 0.0.1
Write a program called console.py that contains the entry point of the command interpreter

7. Console 0.1
Update your command interpreter (console.py) to have these commands

8. First User
Write a class User that inherits from BaseModel

9. More classes!
Write all those classes that inherit from BaseModel

10. Console 1.0
Update FileStorage to manage correctly serialization and deserialization of all our new classes: Place, State, City, Amenity and Review

Update your command interpreter (console.py) to allow those actions: show, create, destroy, update and all with all classes created previously.

11. All instances by class name
Update your command interpreter (console.py) to retrieve all instances of a class by using: <class name>.all().

12. Count instances
Update your command interpreter (console.py) to retrieve the number of instances of a class: <class name>.count().

13. Show
Update your command interpreter (console.py) to retrieve an instance based on its ID: <class name>.show(<id>).

Errors management must be the same as previously.

14. Destroy
Update your command interpreter (console.py) to destroy an instance based on his ID: <class name>.destroy(<id>).

Errors management must be the same as previously.
15. Update
Update your command interpreter (console.py) to update an instance based on his ID: <class name>.update(<id>, <attribute name>, <attribute value>).

Errors management must be the same as previously.

16. Update from dictionary
Update your command interpreter (console.py) to update an instance based on his ID with a dictionary: <class name>.update(<id>, <dictionary representation>).

Errors management must be the same as previously.

17. Unittests for the Console!
Write all unittests for console.py, all features!

For testing the console, you  STDOUT of it, we highly recommend you to use
